### Code the way you know

Build panels in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Build plug-ins in C++ in your favorite Windows or MacOS development tools. Build scripts in JavaScript, AppleScript, or VBScript.

### Enhance and extend

The Illustrator API opens the entire application to your control. Your extensions can add new functions, automate workflows, and drive Illustrator the way you want.
