# Extend the power of Illustrator

Extend and enhance Adobe Illustrator to give users power and control over their vector image projects: create custom filters and effects, organize layers, optimize point data, and automate tasks. Import and export custom file formats and process images in bulk.

### Code the way you know

Build panels in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Build plug-ins in C++ in your favorite Windows or MacOS development tools. Build scripts in JavaScript, AppleScript, or VBScript.

### Enhance and extend

The Illustrator API opens the entire application to your control. Your extensions can add new functions, and automate workflows.

### Edit art directly

Parse and manipulate image data to apply custom effects. Select, manipulate, edit and enhance text. Even generate art automatically from point data and layers.

### Enhance the UI

Add your own custom tools to the toolbar and functions to the menus. Create HTML-based panels that offer new capabilities and connect to other apps across the web.

#### Use callback functions and events

Use both scripting and actions to build automations, respond to events, and implement custom call-back functions.
